## Overview
This project applies the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to predict customer churn based on demographic and service usage data. By analyzing patterns, we can classify customers into different service groups and identify those at risk of churning.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of customer information, including:
- **Demographics**: Age, Region, Marital Status
- **Service Usage**: Tenure, Income, Employment Status
- **Target Variable**: `custcat` (Customer Category with four groups)

## Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, standardizing features
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions
3. **Feature Selection**: Identifying important attributes for classification
4. **Model Training**: Applying KNN with different `k` values
5. **Evaluation**: Finding the best `k` value based on accuracy

## Results
- The best accuracy was observed with **k=9**, as determined through model evaluation.
- Standardization improved classification performance.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
